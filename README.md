# handwriting sheets

Finding sheets for my son to practise handwriting is a hell of paywalled garbage. I want
a way to generate printable PDFs for handwriting practise with a NZ font.

Thanks to [tobi](https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/4918/tobi) for this stackoverflow
[answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/140514/handwriting-drill-sheets) that
 does what I wanted with a couple of tweaks.
