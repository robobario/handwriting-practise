Dogs are wonderful creatures. They can do different things, like fetching a ball or barking at the mailman. One day, a little boy decided to take his dog on a walk. They went down to the park and played all day. The dog was so happy to be with his best friend. When it was time to go home, the little boy had to decide if he wanted to go down or up the hill. He chose down and they walked all the way home together.
