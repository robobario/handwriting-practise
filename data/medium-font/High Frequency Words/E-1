Every evening, Ethan would walk to the river to see the eels. Each time he went, he would try to catch one, but they were too slippery. One day, he saw a big eel with an eye staring right at him. He waited patiently, and finally, the eel came close enough for Ethan to catch it. He couldn't believe it! He let the eel go back into the water, feeling happy and proud of his achievement.
