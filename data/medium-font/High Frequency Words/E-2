Electricity is a type of energy that powers our homes, schools and cities. It is created by tiny particles called electrons that move through wires. Every time you switch on a light, plug in a phone charger or use a computer, you are using electricity. It is important to be careful around electricity and never touch electrical wires or appliances with wet hands, as it can be very dangerous.
