Eddie the elephant was excited for the school talent show. He had a new act he had been practicing for weeks - juggling eggs! But on the day of the show, Eddie accidentally dropped one of the eggs and it broke. He felt embarrassed and wanted to hide, but his friend Ellie the emu encouraged him to be honest and tell the judges what happened. Eddie did just that and was surprised to find that the judges appreciated his honesty and rewarded him with first place. Eddie learned that even when things don't go as planned, honesty is always the best policy.
