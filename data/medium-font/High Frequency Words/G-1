Gloria the grateful girl had a great group of friends who always gave her a reason to be grateful. She would get up every morning and say "Good morning" to the world. She would give thanks for everything she had, big or small. She was glad to be alive and was grateful for every moment. She would go out and get some fresh air and enjoy the beauty of nature. And with her grateful heart, she knew that life was great and full of blessings.
