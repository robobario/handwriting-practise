Henry was a small hare who loved to hop around the meadow. One day, while he was playing, he heard a strange noise coming from the nearby forest. Henry was hesitant to go, but his curiosity got the better of him. As he entered the forest, he saw a huge bear stuck in a trap. Despite his fear, Henry knew he had to help. He hopped over to the bear and with his strong hind legs, pushed the trap open. The bear was grateful and thanked Henry. From that day on, the bear and the hare became the best of friends, and Henry learned that sometimes, even the smallest acts of courage can lead to great friendships.
