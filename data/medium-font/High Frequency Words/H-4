Haley the hippo had a heart full of kindness. She helped hedgehogs, hares, and hummingbirds with haste. Her hugs were heavenly and her heart was huge. She happily handed out healthy treats to everyone she met. One hot day, Haley hurried to help a helpless hare who was hurt. She held his hand, hummed a happy tune, and helped heal his wounds. Her kindness was contagious, and it helped heal the hare's heart too.
