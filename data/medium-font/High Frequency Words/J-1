Jenny felt joy when her parents gave her a job to take care of their new puppy. She joined her friends at the park but just for a while, as she needed to return home to feed the pup. Her parents praised her for her justice and responsibility, and they decided to let her join them on a family trip in June. Jenny felt proud as she packed her bag and knew she could be trusted to judge her actions and make good choices. She kept a journal throughout the trip, and in July, she showed it to her parents. They were impressed with her maturity and told her how proud they were of her.
