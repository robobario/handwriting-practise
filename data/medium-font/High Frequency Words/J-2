Jake was a jolly boy, but he struggled with responsibility. His mum told him, "Jake, it's your job to clean your room and join us for dinner." Just as he was about to play, he remembered his responsibility. He joined his family for dinner and felt just and fair. He knew he was a good judge of his own actions. From then on, Jake kept a journal and marked each day he fulfilled his responsibilities.
