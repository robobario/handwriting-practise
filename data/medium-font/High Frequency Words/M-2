Maggie, the magician, was mesmerising. Her magical mastery was magnificent, and her mischievous mannerisms made her marvellous. She made marigolds appear from her magic wand, and made monkeys and macaws march to her music. The children were amazed at her magic tricks, and marvelled at her mysterious methods. Maggie was a magical muse, and the children would always remember her mesmerising moments. The magic show may have ended, but the memories would last a lifetime.
