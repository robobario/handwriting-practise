Parents Peter and Paula had a problem. They wanted to plan a party for their precious 8-year-old, but they didn't know where to place it. They pondered and pointed at different places, but none of them seemed perfect. Finally, they put their heads together and came up with a plan. They would have the party in the park! They packed plenty of pizza, popcorn, and punch for all the people who would attend. The party was a huge success, and everyone had a pleasant time playing games and participating in activities.
