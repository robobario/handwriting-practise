Two tiny trousers tumbled through the town, twirling and twisting as they traveled. They tripped over a tree trunk and tumbled into a pond, where they were trapped by two turtles. The turtles tried to tug them out, but the trousers were too tight. Then, two toads came to the rescue and tugged them free with their tongues. The trousers thanked the toads and continued their travels through town.
