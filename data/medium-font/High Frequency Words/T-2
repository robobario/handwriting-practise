In a town of two, Tom and Tina took turns talking. They thought this was the best way to make their town thrive. Together they toiled, tending to their tilled land and trading trinkets with traders that traveled through town. They taught their townsfolk the tricks of trade and tried to teach them tolerance too. The townsfolk thanked them for their tireless efforts and thought of them as true leaders. Together they thrived in their tiny town, making it a place where everyone could be happy.
