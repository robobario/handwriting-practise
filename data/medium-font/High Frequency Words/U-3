Up until now, Uncle Ulysses had never upgraded his old car. He used it for years, but it was time to get something new. He went to the dealership and found a shiny, new car that he could use for many more years. He understood the importance of having a reliable vehicle and was excited to drive it home. Underneath the hood, he could see all the upgrades that made this car special. He knew he had made the right choice and couldn't wait to use it!
