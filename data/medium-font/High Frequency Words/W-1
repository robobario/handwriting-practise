Wally was a water wizard who lived in a wetland. He would wander the wetlands with his friends, weaving wonderful waterworks. One day, Wally wanted to win a wacky water race. He worked with his friends to build a wild wheeled wagon that would whiz through the waves. With willpower and wit, Wally won the race! His friends cheered and celebrated with him, and they all went home with wide smiles on their faces.
