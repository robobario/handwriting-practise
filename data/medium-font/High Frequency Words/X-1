Once upon a time, there was a young fox named Xavier who lived in the woods. He loved to explore and often found himself in sticky situations. One day, Xavier stumbled upon an old xylophone and decided to take it home. As he walked, he heard a strange noise coming from the xylophone. When he looked closer, he saw that it was full of tiny x-ray bugs! Xavier quickly put the lid back on and ran away with the xylophone.
