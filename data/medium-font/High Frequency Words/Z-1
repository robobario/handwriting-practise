Zoey zoomed around the zoo, zigzagging between zebras and zipping past the zeppelin. She zoomed to the zoo's entrance, where she found a zipper and unzipped it to find a zany zoo of zany animals. Zoey was so excited that she started to zip around the zoo again, this time with her new friends. She had so much fun that she decided to come back every day for a week, zooming and zipping around until she knew all the animals' names.
