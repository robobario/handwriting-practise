Zoey zoomed around the zoo, zipping past zebras and zigzagging between zeppelins. She zoomed so quickly that she zapped a zebra with her zany zest! Zoey was so zealous that she even zoomed past the zookeeper, who was too busy zoning out to notice. Zoey's zeal for the zoo was only matched by her love of words starting with 'z', like zipper, zigzag, and zany.
