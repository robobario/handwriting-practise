Cody was playing Minecraft when he saw his friend, Cameron, come online. "Can you join my game?" Cody asked. "Sure, I could play with you," Cameron replied. Together, they built a castle with towers and a moat. They explored caves and found diamonds. They had so much fun, they couldn't wait to come back and play again!
