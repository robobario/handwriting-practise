In a far-off land, there were dragons of all shapes and sizes. They could do amazing things, like breathe fire and fly. One day, a brave knight decided to go down to their lair and face them. He had to decide if he was ready to face possible death. But he realized something different about the dragons: they were kind and just wanted to be friends. They spent the day playing and having fun, and the knight realized he didn't need to fight them after all.
