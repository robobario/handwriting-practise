Freddy the fox had a dream to fly high,
But with his small wings, he couldn't touch the sky.
He practiced and tried, but failed every time,
Yet he didn't give up, his spirit sublime.

He asked his friends for help, who cheered him on,
Even when things went wrong, he remained strong.
For days and nights, he worked with his heart,
Until one fine day, he soared like a dart.
