Five friends were playing at the park when they met Felix, a foreigner. They felt fascinated by his funny accent, and they talked about his country's food, culture and dance. They all became friends and decided to create a festival to celebrate their diversity. Friends and families joined them, sharing their own unique cultures. Felix even taught them a traditional dance, and they performed it together. Everyone had a fantastic time, and they learned that diversity makes life fun and exciting.
