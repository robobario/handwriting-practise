Farmer Fred faced a big problem on his farm. His fence had fallen and the foxes were feasting on his flock. He felt frustrated, but his faithful dog, Fido, was there to help. Together they searched for a fix. They found some fallen trees and fashioned them into fence posts. They used fence wire to secure them, but it was still flimsy. Fido fetched some fir branches to fill the gaps. Finally, the fence was fixed and Fred felt relieved. Thanks to their teamwork and resourcefulness, they solved the problem and kept the farm safe.
