Great geysers gush grandly in geothermal geographies. Glimmering geysers, gigantic geysers, garrulous geysers, giddy geysers! Green grass grows around great geysers, gleaming glaciers glitter in the distance. Giggling geese gather to glimpse the glorious geysers. Gushing geysers give great gifts of geothermal energy, generating great growth and giving geologists a glimpse into the grand geology of the globe.
