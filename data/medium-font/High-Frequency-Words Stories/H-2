Harry the hedgehog had never left his hedge before. He was always afraid of what could happen outside, but he knew he had to be brave. Harry took a deep breath and hopped out of his home. He was surprised to see a hungry hawk looking for a meal. Harry quickly hid behind a nearby house. He realized he had to act quickly, so he gathered all his courage and came up with a plan. He made a loud noise to scare the hawk away, and it worked! Harry felt proud of himself for being so brave, and he knew he could be courageous again if he needed to be.
