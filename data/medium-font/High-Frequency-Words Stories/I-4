Peter Pan was a playful lad, living in the isles of Neverland. In his heart, he had an inkling to fly, to explore, to imagine and to defy. In his dreams, he found a land of great surprise, with indigo skies and islands in the ice. In his adventures, he met new friends and foes, with their own interests and ideas to propose. In his quest, he learned to be independent and inventive, to use his intuition and intelligence to be selective. For Peter Pan knew that with creativity and courage, he could find his way and win every scrimmage.
