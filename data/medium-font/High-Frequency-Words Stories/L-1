Lila loved living in the lush land of New Zealand. She loved the way the leaves on the trees looked like they were waving hello and how the sun left the sky with a lovely pink last light. She loved spending time with her family, playing and laughing a lot. Her mum taught her to let love into her life and to always look for the good. Lila knew she was loved and she loved everything about her life.
