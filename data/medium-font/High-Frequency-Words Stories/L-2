Lila loved to listen to the birds chirping in the morning light. She would lie in her bed and listen to their melodic tunes until it was time to start her day. Love was something that she felt not just for the natural world around her, but for her family and friends too. Her favourite time was when her family would sit around the table and laugh over dinner, enjoying each other's company. Love was the glue that held them together, and Lila was grateful for every moment they shared.
