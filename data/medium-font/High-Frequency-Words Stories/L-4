Lava was lurking below the land, lying low, like a lion ready to pounce on its prey. Lava was liquid, it flowed fast and free, like a lake of lava. Leaping and lunging, lava left a lasting legacy of destruction in its wake. The light from the lava was luminous and luscious, illuminating the landscape like a lighthouse. Listening to the lava's low rumbling was like listening to a lion's roar. Lava was both lovely and lethal, like a lullaby and a lightning bolt all at once.
