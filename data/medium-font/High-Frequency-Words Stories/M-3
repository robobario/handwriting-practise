Mischievous monkeys made merry in the mango tree. Munching on mangos, they were so happy and carefree. More monkeys joined in and the mangoes disappeared. Monkeys laughed and played as the mango juice smeared. Many monkeys swung from branch to branch, all day long. Most monkeys were friends, but some monkeys just didn't belong. Mama monkey came to make sure all the little ones were okay. Monkeys chattered and played until the end of the day.
