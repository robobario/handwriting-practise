Nellie loved nature, she knew no bounds when it came to exploring. Now, she wandered in the woods, finding new flowers and ferns. No other place made her feel as alive as nature. Needing a break, she stopped and took in the night sounds. Nellie noticed a nest, and she was curious. Never before had she seen so many birds in one place. Nellie was in awe of the number of birds. New discoveries were always around every corner, and Nellie was excited to find them.
