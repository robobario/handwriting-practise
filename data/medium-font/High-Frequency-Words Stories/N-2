Nancy the squirrel loved to nibble on nuts. She had a nose for finding the perfect ones. One day, while scampering in the forest, she stumbled upon a nut tree that was never noticed before. She couldn't resist nibbling on one, then two, then three nuts. Soon, she was so engrossed in her nut feast, she didn't notice the nearby net that a nut farmer had set up to catch squirrels. Luckily, she managed to escape, learned her lesson, and now keeps a watchful eye when nut hunting.
