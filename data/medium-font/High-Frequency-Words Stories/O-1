Oliver the owl had opinions on everything. One day, he overheard an otter express an opinion that he disagreed with. Oliver was outraged and argued with the otter. Others joined in, and soon everyone was arguing! Eventually, Oliver realised that opinions are like onions - they have layers. He learned to listen to others and respect their opinions, even if he didn't agree. Oliver felt happier and more open-minded than ever before. From then on, he was known as the wise old owl who never judged others for their opinions.
