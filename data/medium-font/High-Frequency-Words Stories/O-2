Once upon a time, in an orchard of onions, lived an owl named Ollie. Ollie loved to observe the onion plants as they grew. One day, Ollie noticed that one onion was out of place. He investigated and discovered an odd creature - an ostrich! Ollie and the ostrich became friends, and they spent many hours together, enjoying the orchard. The onion farmer was surprised to find an ostrich in his onions, but with Ollie's opinion, he decided to let the two enjoy their time together. And so, Ollie and the ostrich lived happily ever after in the onion orchard.
