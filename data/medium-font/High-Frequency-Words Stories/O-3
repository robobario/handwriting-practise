Once upon a time, in an old oak tree, an observant owl named Oliver lived. Oliver was known for his orange eyes and outstanding ability to observe. One ominous October evening, Oliver overheard an odd occurrence. He observed an owl orchestra's opening act, orchestrated by an old owl named Oscar. Oscar's orchestra occupied all other owls' opportunities to perform. Overcome with outrage, Oliver offered Oscar an opportunity to perform an original owl operetta. Oscar accepted, and Oliver and Oscar performed a phenomenal owl operetta, one other owls observed out of their old oak tree.
