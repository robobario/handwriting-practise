Once upon a time, there was an old owl who owned an orchard of oranges. Every other day, he'd offer one orange to each of the other animals in the forest. The fox, ferret, and frog were overjoyed at the old owl's generosity and often offered to help out with the orchard's upkeep. But the old owl always said no; it was his own responsibility to take care of his oranges. So every morning, he'd wake up early and tend to his orchard until the sun went down. He knew that ownership came with hard work and dedication, but it was worth it for the joy of having something all his own.
