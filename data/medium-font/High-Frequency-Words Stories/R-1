Once upon a time, there was a room filled with really remarkable things. A rabbit ran quickly around the room, reading all the signs and labels. Right away, it noticed a red rocking chair and decided to rest in it. Suddenly, the rabbit heard a loud rumble coming from the corner of the room. It quickly hopped off the chair and ran to investigate. To its surprise, it found a robot rolling around on wheels! The robot said "Hello! I'm here to help you read all these signs!" The rabbit thanked the robot and they both began to explore the room together.
