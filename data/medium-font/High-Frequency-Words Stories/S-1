Sally was a young girl with an active imagination. She saw the world in a special way, and she could see things that others couldn't. She should explore her creativity and use it to make something special. So she set out on a journey of discovery, seeing sights and sounds that no one else could see or hear. She saw shapes in the clouds and heard music in the wind. Some days she'd soar high above the trees, while other days she'd dive deep into the sea. Everywhere Sally went, her imagination followed, showing her new wonders every day.
