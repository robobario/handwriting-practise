Once upon a time, there were two weasels who lived in the woods. Wilbur and Wanda were always up to something, whether it was weaving through the trees or wiggling their way into mischief. One day, they decided to wander off in search of adventure. They soon stumbled upon a wide river with a wooden bridge that crossed it. Wilbur wanted to cross but Wanda was worried about what would happen if they fell in. With some convincing, Wilbur finally convinced Wanda to take the risk and together they walked across the bridge. When they reached the other side, they were filled with wonder at all the new sights and sounds around them! They had an amazing day exploring and when it was time to go home, Wilbur and Wanda knew that this was only the beginning of their wild adventures!
