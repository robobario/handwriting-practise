Wally and his family went walking in the woods. They wondered what wildlife they would witness, who would win the race, and will they find a way out? Wally wanted to wander with his family, but his mom warned him to watch where he was going. As they walked, Wally noticed wildflowers and wished he could pick them. His dad said no, but promised they would come back soon. Wally smiled and kept walking with his family.
