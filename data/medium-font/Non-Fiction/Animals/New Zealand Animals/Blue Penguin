The Blue Penguin, also known as the Little Penguin, is the smallest species of penguin in the world, and it's native to New Zealand. These cute birds only grow to be about 30 centimeters tall and weigh around 1 kilogram. They have a blue-grey plumage on their back and white on their chest and belly. They're amazing swimmers and can dive up to 20 meters deep to catch small fish and krill. Blue Penguins are also great climbers, and they use their sharp claws to climb rocks and cliffs. At night, they come back to their burrows on the beach to rest and sleep. They're known for their distinctive braying call, which can be heard from a distance. Blue Penguins are a popular attraction in New Zealand and are beloved by locals and visitors alike.
