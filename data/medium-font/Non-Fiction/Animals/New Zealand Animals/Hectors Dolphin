Hector's Dolphin is a small, rare species of dolphin that is only found in New Zealand waters. They are one of the smallest dolphin species in the world, measuring just 1.2-1.4 meters in length and weighing up to 60 kg. Hector's Dolphins are easily recognizable with their distinctive black and white markings, and they have a rounded dorsal fin. These dolphins are very friendly and curious, often approaching boats and swimmers. Sadly, they are endangered, with only around 15,000 individuals left in the world. It's important that we do what we can to protect these amazing creatures and their habitat.
