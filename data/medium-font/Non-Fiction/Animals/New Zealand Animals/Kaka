The Kaka is a large parrot native to New Zealand. It has a mostly brownish-green plumage with red under its wings, and a distinctive curved beak. Kaka are very intelligent and are known for their playful and curious personalities. They are also known for their loud and unique calls, which can often be heard echoing through the forest. Kaka are omnivores and feed on a variety of foods including fruits, seeds, nectar, insects, and even small animals. Unfortunately, the Kaka population has decreased over time due to habitat loss and hunting. However, conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve this fascinating bird.
