The Kea is a smart and playful bird that lives in the mountains of New Zealand. They are known for their bright green feathers and curious nature. Keas are the only alpine parrot in the world, and they are also one of the smartest birds. They are great problem solvers and can even figure out how to use tools to get food. Keas are also known for their mischievous behavior, as they love to play pranks on people and animals. Unfortunately, Keas are endangered, with only around 5,000 left in the wild, so it's important to protect them and their habitat.
