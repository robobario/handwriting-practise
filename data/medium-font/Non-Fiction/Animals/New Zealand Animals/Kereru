The Kereru, also known as the New Zealand Pigeon, is a large, colourful bird that is found throughout New Zealand. They are easily recognisable by their iridescent green and purple feathers, and their distinctive wobbling flight. Kereru play an important role in dispersing seeds from native trees, helping to maintain the health and diversity of New Zealand's forests. They are one of the only birds in the world that can eat the large fruit of the taraire tree, which is too big for most other birds to swallow. Kereru are also known to be very friendly, and will often let people get quite close to them without flying away. Unfortunately, their numbers have been declining in some parts of the country, so it is important to help protect them by preserving their habitats and controlling introduced predators.
