The kiwi is a small, flightless bird that is native to New Zealand. It is a national symbol of the country and has many unique features. Kiwis have small, vestigial wings that are hidden under their feathers, and they have a long beak that is used to sniff out insects and grubs in the forest floor. They are nocturnal birds, which means they are most active at night, and they have very good hearing and smell, but their eyesight is not very good. Kiwis also have strong legs that allow them to run quickly and dig burrows to hide in during the day. Interestingly, the kiwi lays one of the largest eggs in proportion to its body size of any bird species. Kiwis are very special birds, and it is important to protect their habitat to ensure their survival for future generations.
