The Longfin Eel, or Tuna, is a unique species of freshwater eel found in New Zealand's rivers and streams. They can grow up to a metre long and weigh over 16kg! One of the most interesting things about the Longfin Eel is their life cycle. They are born in the ocean near Tonga and Samoa, and then travel thousands of kilometres to reach New Zealand's rivers and streams. They spend many years living in fresh water, growing and maturing, before making the long journey back to the ocean to spawn and die. Longfin Eels have been an important part of MƒÅori culture and traditional cuisine for hundreds of years. They are considered a taonga, or treasure, and are an important species for conservation efforts.
