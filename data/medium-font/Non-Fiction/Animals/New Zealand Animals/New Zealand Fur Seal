The New Zealand Fur Seal is a fascinating marine mammal that can be found along the coastlines of New Zealand. They have a dark brown fur coat that helps to keep them warm in the chilly waters. These seals are very agile swimmers and can dive up to 120 meters deep and stay underwater for over 10 minutes. They feed on a variety of fish, squid, and octopus. During the breeding season, male seals can be heard making loud barks and grunts to defend their territory and attract females. Female seals give birth to their pups on land and take care of them for several months until they are old enough to venture out to sea. These adorable creatures are a delight to watch in their natural habitat and it's important that we do our best to protect them and their environment.
