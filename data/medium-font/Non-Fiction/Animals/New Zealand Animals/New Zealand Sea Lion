The New Zealand Sea Lion is a special animal that can only be found in New Zealand. They are one of the rarest sea lion species in the world and are protected by law. These sea lions are known for their large size and can weigh up to 400kg! They have a distinct dark brown coat with light fur around their necks. New Zealand Sea Lions live in the southern parts of New Zealand and are amazing swimmers, being able to dive up to 200 metres deep in the ocean. They are also very playful and can often be seen jumping out of the water or playing with seaweed. However, it's important to remember that these sea lions are wild animals and should be admired from a safe distance to protect both humans and the sea lions themselves.
