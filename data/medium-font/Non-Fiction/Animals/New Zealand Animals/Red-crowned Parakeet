The Red-crowned Parakeet, also known as the Kakariki, is a brightly coloured bird that is native to New Zealand. These birds are easily recognisable by their bright green feathers and red foreheads. They can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, scrublands, and farmland. The Red-crowned Parakeet is a social bird that lives in flocks and is known for its playful and curious nature. They are also very vocal, communicating with a range of calls and squawks. Sadly, the Red-crowned Parakeet was once endangered due to habitat loss and predation by introduced mammals, but conservation efforts have helped their populations recover in recent years.
