The Royal Albatross is the largest seabird in New Zealand, with a wingspan of up to 3 meters! They are also one of the largest birds in the world. These birds mate for life and return to the same breeding site every year, which is on the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin. The Royal Albatross is a very special bird to the Maori people, who consider them to be a symbol of good luck and a messenger from the gods. Sadly, these majestic birds are now endangered due to fishing practices, pollution, and habitat destruction. It's important for us to protect them and their habitat so that they can continue to soar through our skies for generations to come.
