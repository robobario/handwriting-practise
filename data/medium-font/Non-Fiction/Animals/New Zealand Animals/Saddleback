The Saddleback, also known as the Tieke, is a small bird native to New Zealand. It gets its name from the distinctive brown saddle-like markings on its back. Saddlebacks were once widespread throughout New Zealand, but they became almost extinct in the 20th century due to habitat loss and introduced predators like rats and stoats. However, thanks to conservation efforts, they have made a comeback and can now be found on a few predator-free islands and protected sanctuaries on the mainland. Saddlebacks are known for their curious and friendly nature, and they have a loud, distinctive call. They mainly eat insects and fruits, and they are important for seed dispersal in forests.
