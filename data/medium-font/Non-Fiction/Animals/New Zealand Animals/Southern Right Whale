The Southern Right Whale is one of the largest animals in the world and can grow up to 16 meters long! They are called "right" whales because they were the "right" whales to hunt for their valuable blubber, but thankfully they are now protected in New Zealand waters. Southern Right Whales are known for their V-shaped blowholes and huge heads, which can make up to one-third of their body length. They can also hold their breath for up to 40 minutes when diving for food, which includes krill and small fish. During breeding season, they come to New Zealand waters to mate and give birth to their calves. Southern Right Whales are a rare and special sight to see, and we are lucky to have them in our waters.
