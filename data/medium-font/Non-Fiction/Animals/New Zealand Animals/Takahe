The Takahe is a flightless bird and is one of New Zealand's most endangered species. They are about the size of a chicken and have bright blue and green feathers on their wings and back. Takahe can only be found in a few remote alpine valleys in the South Island. They are herbivores, and their favourite food is tussock grass. Takahe are very rare and were once thought to be extinct until a small population was found in 1948. Conservation efforts have been put in place to protect them, and now there are around 400 Takahe living in the wild.
