The Tuatara is a unique animal that can only be found in New Zealand. They are not lizards, but are actually part of their own group of reptiles. Tuataras are very interesting because they have a "third eye" on the top of their head that is used to help regulate their body temperature. They are also known for having very long lives, with some living up to 100 years old! Another interesting fact is that tuataras have a special type of teeth that are fused to their jawbone, and they continue to grow throughout their lives. Although they are not commonly seen in the wild, they are important to the Maori people and are often depicted in their art and stories.
