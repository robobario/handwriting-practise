The Tui is a native bird of New Zealand and is known for its beautiful, melodic singing. They have shiny black feathers with a tuft of white feathers at the neck, and a distinctive white patch of feathers under their throat. Tuis are very intelligent birds and are known for their ability to mimic other bird calls and even sounds made by humans. They are also important pollinators, feeding on the nectar of flowers and spreading pollen as they move from plant to plant. Tuis can often be seen flitting between the branches of trees and bushes, and their beautiful songs can be heard throughout the forests of New Zealand.
