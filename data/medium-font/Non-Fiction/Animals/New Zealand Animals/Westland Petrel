The Westland Petrel, also known as the Taiko in Maori, is a seabird that is found only in New Zealand. It is a large bird, with a wingspan of around 1.5 meters! Westland Petrels are unique because they spend most of their lives at sea, only coming to land to breed in the rugged forests of the South Island's West Coast. They are also known for their unusual habit of using their sense of smell to locate food - a rare ability in birds. Unfortunately, Westland Petrels are classified as critically endangered, with only around 4,000 birds estimated to remain in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this special bird and its habitat.
