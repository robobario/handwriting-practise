The weta is a unique and fascinating insect that can be found in New Zealand. There are over 70 species of weta, and they come in all shapes and sizes. Some weta are small and can fit on your finger, while others are large and heavy, with some weighing as much as a small bird! Weta have powerful legs that help them climb trees and other surfaces, and they are also known for their strong jaws, which they use to eat plants and insects. Another interesting fact about weta is that they are nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night. Despite their sometimes creepy appearance, weta are an important part of New Zealand's ecosystem and are considered a national treasure.
