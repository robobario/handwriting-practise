The Yellow-eyed Penguin is one of the rarest penguins in the world and can only be found in New Zealand. These adorable penguins are named after their bright yellow eyes and unique yellow feather pattern around their heads. They are also one of the largest penguin species, with adults growing up to 65 cm tall and weighing up to 6 kg. Sadly, the Yellow-eyed Penguin is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss, predation, and human disturbance. However, conservation efforts are being made to protect them and their habitats. If you're ever lucky enough to spot one of these amazing creatures, make sure to keep a respectful distance and enjoy watching them waddle and swim in their natural habitat.
