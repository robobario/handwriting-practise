Bomber aircraft are planes that are designed to drop bombs on targets on the ground, such as enemy troops, vehicles, or buildings. They played a crucial role in many wars throughout history, including World War II. One of the most famous bomber planes was the B-52 Stratofortress, which was used by the United States Air Force in the Vietnam War. The B-52 had a wingspan of 185 feet and could carry up to 70,000 pounds of bombs. In New Zealand, the RNZAF used the Vickers Vincent and the Bristol Blenheim as bomber aircraft during World War II. Today, bomber aircraft are still used by many countries around the world as a means of strategic attack and defense.
