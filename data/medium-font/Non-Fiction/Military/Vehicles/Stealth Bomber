Stealth bombers are some of the most fascinating military aircraft in the world. They are also known as "invisible planes" because of their unique design that makes them nearly invisible to radar. The most famous stealth bomber is the B-2 Spirit, which was first introduced in 1997. It's a large, sleek plane that can fly at extremely high altitudes and carry a massive amount of weaponry. The B-2 Spirit has a unique "flying wing" design that helps it to evade detection by enemy radar systems. These planes are extremely expensive and are used only for the most important missions. They are also very difficult to fly and require highly skilled pilots to operate them. Despite their impressive capabilities, stealth bombers are very rare, with only a few countries in the world possessing them.
