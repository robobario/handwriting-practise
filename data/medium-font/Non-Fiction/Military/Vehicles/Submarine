Submarines are underwater vehicles that are used by the Navy to carry out various tasks such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and attacking enemy vessels. They are designed to operate underwater for long periods of time and can travel at high speeds without being detected. Submarines are equipped with a variety of advanced technologies such as sonar and periscopes, which allow the crew to see and hear what's going on around them. They also have torpedoes and missiles that can be launched at enemy targets. Submarines come in different sizes, with some being as small as a few meters long, while others can be over 100 meters long.
