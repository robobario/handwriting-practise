Military tanks are heavily armored vehicles that have been used in wars for over a century. They are designed for use in combat and are equipped with powerful weapons that can take out enemy vehicles and fortifications. The first tank was built in 1915 and since then, tanks have become an important part of military strategy. Tanks are also known for their distinctive treads, which allow them to traverse difficult terrain like mud and snow. Some tanks can reach speeds of up to 70 km/h and can travel over rough terrain. Tanks have played a crucial role in many conflicts throughout history, and continue to be used in modern warfare.
