An aircraft carrier is a huge ship that is used by the military to transport and launch planes. These ships are like floating cities, with their own hospitals, kitchens, and living quarters for the crew. The planes that launch from the carrier's deck can be used for a variety of missions, such as surveillance, attack, or reconnaissance. The aircraft carrier is a powerful and important tool for a country's military, as it can operate in waters around the world and project military power over long distances. The biggest aircraft carriers are over 300 meters long and can carry up to 100 planes.
