Armoured Personnel Carrier, or APC for short, is a military vehicle that is designed to transport troops and provide them with protection against enemy fire. The APC is heavily armoured and has gun ports to allow the soldiers inside to fire back at the enemy if they are attacked. APCs are used to transport troops across the battlefield, to provide cover during an attack, or to evacuate wounded soldiers. They are also used for peacekeeping missions to transport troops and equipment across rough terrain. Some APCs are even amphibious, meaning they can operate on both land and water. APCs come in a variety of sizes and shapes and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the military.
