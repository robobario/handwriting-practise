An Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) is a type of military vehicle that can operate on both land and water. These vehicles are often used by the military to transport troops and supplies from ships to shore during amphibious operations. AAVs are designed to be heavily armored, with a reinforced hull to protect the crew and passengers from enemy fire. They can travel at high speeds both on land and in the water, making them a versatile tool for military operations. Some AAVs can also be outfitted with weapons such as machine guns or grenade launchers, giving them the ability to engage enemy targets from the safety of their armored shell. Overall, AAVs are an important component of any amphibious assault operation, providing vital transportation and protection for military personnel.
