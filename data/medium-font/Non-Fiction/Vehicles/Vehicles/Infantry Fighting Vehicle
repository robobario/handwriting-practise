An Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) is a type of armoured vehicle that is designed to transport and support infantry troops in combat. IFVs are equipped with weapons systems like machine guns, cannons, and missiles, making them very versatile on the battlefield. They are heavily armoured to protect soldiers from enemy fire and explosives. IFVs have tracks or wheels that allow them to move over rough terrain and to cross water. Some IFVs can even swim! These vehicles are an important part of modern military operations, allowing soldiers to move quickly and safely through dangerous areas.
