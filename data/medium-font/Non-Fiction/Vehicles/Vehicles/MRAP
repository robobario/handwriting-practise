MRAP stands for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected. MRAP vehicles are a type of military vehicle designed to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and ambushes. They have a V-shaped hull that deflects the force of a blast away from the vehicle and its occupants. MRAPs are heavily armored and can withstand small-arms fire, artillery shells, and roadside bombs. They have been used extensively in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect soldiers from the dangers of these conflicts. In addition to their protective features, MRAPs are also equipped with advanced communication and surveillance systems that allow soldiers to stay connected and aware of their surroundings.
