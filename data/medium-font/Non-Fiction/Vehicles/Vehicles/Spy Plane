Spy planes, also known as reconnaissance planes or surveillance aircraft, are used to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance missions. These planes are equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that can detect and capture images of targets from high altitudes. Spy planes have played a crucial role in various military operations and have helped provide important information about enemy movements, terrain, and potential threats. One famous spy plane is the U-2, which was used by the United States during the Cold War to gather intelligence on the Soviet Union. Today, spy planes continue to be used by military forces around the world for both reconnaissance and surveillance missions.
