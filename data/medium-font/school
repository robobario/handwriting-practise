Tom was up early, so excited for school. He had his brekkie, put on his new sneakers, and grabbed his bag. He walked to school with his mates, chatting and laughing. When he got to class, he learned new things and made more friends. He loved playing at lunchtime with his buddies on the playground. He couldn't wait to go back tomorrow to see what new things he would learn and what adventures he would have.
